        <h1>How it Works</h1>
        <p>Monthlys helps you narrow things down to the things you
        need or absolutely love and makes it easy to turn them on as a
        service. Enter your billing info once and turn on or off as
        many subscriptions as you'd like - even try things just once
        for an occasional, curated kick. What a life it would be if
        everything were brought to you. You could read a book, relax
        or work out, take a class, even spend time working on a
        personal project.</p>
